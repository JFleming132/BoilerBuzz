//TODO: Write this entire file
// in before,
//     create a user
//     have that user create an event
//
// in after,
//    delete the user and his event
//
// Test that the new event shows up when fetching events
// Test that a user can successfully RSVP and it reflects the change in the event and the user
// Test that a user can successfully un-RSVP and it reflects the change in the event and the user. Maybe combine this test and the prev one?
// Test that a user can update the event information
// Test that fetching the events via the user-filter endpoint correctly fetches only events from that user
// Test that a user can delete events
